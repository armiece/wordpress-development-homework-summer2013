Tagged Backgrounds is a Wordpress plugin that allows users to change the background image of post 
pages based on the tags attached to that post. 

== Description ==

Tagged Backgounds is a WordPress customisation plugin that will allow you to set specific background 
images or colors based on the tages attached to a post. These tags can be defined manually. 

It is recommended that users take care which tags they use for this purpose, as conflicts can arise. 
General topic tags (e.g., Politics, Video Games, Design) are recommended over more specific tags.
(Note: Design a way to handle conflicts). 

This plugin may conflict with other plugins that change the backgrounds of themes. 

== Installation ==

Tagged Backgrounds can be installed via the WordPress plugin menu, either via upload or link. To install
the plugin, go to the plugin menu and click on "ADD NEW".

== HOW TO ATTACH BACKGROUNDS TO TAGS ==

The Tagged Background control panel can be accessed in the WordPress Dashboard, found at the following menu:
	Settings -> Tagged Backgrounds

In the control panelyou can view your created Tags as well as the images attached to them. All images will need 
to be uploaded to the site via the WordPress Media Manager; remote linking is not recommended. By default, images 
will stretch to fit and be fixed. Currently, this is not something that can be changed, so please be sure your 
background images are large and of high quality.

To create tags, you merely have to use them when tagging posts. The "Tags" menu under the settings for Tagged
Backgrounds draws from your existing tags database. 

Select a tag, and then insert the link to the desired image next to it. Click "save", and your tag should now
 change the background of post pages!
